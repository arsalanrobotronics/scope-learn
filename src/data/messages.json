Your component architecture is well-structured and you've demonstrated a solid understanding of React patterns.\n\nA few areas for improvement:\n1. Consider implementing error boundaries for better error handling\n2. Add more comprehensive unit tests for edge cases\n3. The state management could be optimized with useCallback hooks\n\nOverall, excellent work! Your grade is 92/100.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. Rodriguez",

I really appreciate the specific areas you highlighted for improvement.\n\nI have a quick question about error boundaries - would you recommend implementing them at the component level or having a global error boundary? Also, could you point me to some resources for advanced React testing patterns?\n\nThanks again for your time and guidance!\n\nBest,\nEmma",

However, I wanted to get your perspective on how she's doing academically and if there are any areas where she might need additional support.\n\nI'd also like to know if there are any upcoming major assignments or projects that she should be preparing for.\n\nThank you for your time and for being such an inspiring teacher for Emma.\n\nBest regards,\nRobert Thompson\nEmma's father",
